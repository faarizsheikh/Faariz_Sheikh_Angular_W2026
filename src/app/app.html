<h2>Why this quote</h2>

<p>
  This line is chilling because of what happens when Pennywise catches his victims.
  Georgie's fate in the film is especially tragic, which gives the quote emotional weight.
</p>

<p>
  Pennywise's ability to create illusions and manipulate perception adds to the horror.
  Notice how Georgie's delivery escalates: neutral → smiling → laughing → serious →
  angry → shouting → yelling. The repetition mirrors psychological pressure.
</p>

<p>
  I am a fan of Stephen King. Works like <em>IT</em> and <em>The Shining</em> explore
  disturbing themes of fear, guilt, and loss, which makes both the books and films compelling.
