<h2>Why this quote:</h2>>
<p>It's chilling, especially because of what happens when Pennywise catches you. Plus, in the film, Georgie's fate was a sad one.

  And the fact that Pennywise can create illusions and do other stuff is creepy. Also, note the way Georgie says the lines
  above where his emotion starts from neutral to smile to laugh. Then, to serious and then to angry then to shouting angrily to shouting angrily.

  I am a fan of Stephen King. IT, The Shining, and all the other books he wrote and even the films based on them... They're interesting. Interesting themes.
